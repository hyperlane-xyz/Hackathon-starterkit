This is your Hackathon Guide to help you deploy your app Interchain, using our Permissionless Interoperability tools to help you expand your ideas on how to make your app more chain rich. 

Check out or [docs](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/introduction/getting-started) to get more complex ideas.

# Hacker Resources

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pre-requirement tools

To interact with Hyperlane contracts you can use any of the following libraries: 

- [EtherJS](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

These tools can be used to not only interact with Hyperlane contracts but to interact with any Web3 app.

## üñ•Ô∏è¬†Quickstart

Looking to send cross-chain message. Use our [Quickstart tutorial](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-quickstart) to help you deploy simple send and receiver contract on any chains.

## üß∞¬†Hyperlane tools which you can use in your project

We have a set of helpful tools which you can easily integrate into your app and integrate it in your project: 

[Accounts API](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/apis/accounts)

- You can use the accounts API to have an account make function calls on another chain, like a DAO can own assets on other chains
- You could build a EIP-5164 implementation, Safe integration, Tally integration

[Queries API](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/apis/query)

- You can use the queries API to read state from a remote chain, for example read a price feed on Ethereum from BSC

[Message API](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/apis/messaging-api)

- Anything that doesn't fit in the above, you can use Hyperlane messaging to send and receive arbitrary bytes between your contracts on different chains.

[Warp Routes API](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/apis/warp-api)

- Looking to have a representation of a token from one chain, on another? Use Warp routes to quickly create a bridge without writing any code

[Permissionless Deployment](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy/deploy-hyperlane)

- Looking to do any of the above, but Hyperlane is not on there? You can use PD to deploy Hyperlane to that chain and then use that to have your app do stuff on there

## üèÜ¬†Hyperlane Bounties

Available on behalf of Hyperlane supported Hackathons. Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hyperlane) to get more information if there's ongoing or upcoming hackathon for submitting your project and get a chance to win one of our Bounties!

$4k - Best use of Permissionless Interoperability

- To qualify you simply need to deploy Hyperlane on a new blockchain or rollup.
- How you utilize your newfound interoperability capabilities will dictate how likely you are to win the grand prize.
- Examples would include deploying to your own rollup created via Celestia, Optimism, Polygon, or any rollup toolkit you‚Äôd like to use.
- Permissionless Interoperability related submissions will be eligible for the other Hyperlane prizes

$2k - Best use of Hyperlane Warp Routes

- Warp Routes are Hyperlane‚Äôs unique take on token bridging. Each Warp Route has its own security model, using Hyperlane‚Äôs Interchain Security Modules. Most importantly, Warp Routes are completely permissionless. You can now bring any asset to any chain.
- To qualify for this prize you simply need to use Warp Routes in your submission.
- Here are some ideas about what you could do:
- Create the first bridge on a new chain! This would also make you eligible for the grand prize.
- Leverage Warp Route‚Äôd assets in an app of your design
- Use Warp Routes to create interchain NFTs or bridge existing collections

$2k - Hyperlane Powered Scaling Infrastructure

- Use Hyperlane to navigate between networks and create scalability focused infrastructure.
- While there is no specific form these should take, here are some ideas:
- Blockchain Smart Router. Imagine being able to route computation to the cheapest blockchain within the Hyperlane network, and then being able to retrieve or read that state whenever necessary from your home chain. Effectively turning any blockchain into your layer 2 and beyond.
- For NFTs, you could create an interchain minting contract that acts as a load balancer between chains, i.e collecting orders on several chains (with lower fees or higher throughput) and executing the mint on a different chain.
